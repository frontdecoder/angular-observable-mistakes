## 🔍 What You’ll Learn

This video and code examples show you how to avoid 3 common RxJS mistakes in Angular:

1. **Forgetting to unsubscribe**  
   → Use `async` pipe, `takeUntil()`, or `take(1)`

2. **Nested subscriptions**  
   → Use `switchMap` or `concatMap` for cleaner, testable code

3. **Overusing Subjects**  
   → Prefer `BehaviorSubject` for shared state or `signals` in Angular 17+
